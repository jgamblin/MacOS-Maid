# MacOS Maid
A simple shell script I run to keep my MacBook clean and patched.

## What It Does:
- Installs Needed System Updates
- Empties The Trash
- Deletes All System Logs
- Deletes The QuickLook files
- Updates And Cleans Homebrew
- Cleans Ruby
- Removes All Docker Containers
- Purges Memory
- Securely Wipe Freespace

## Usage:

- Review for your preferences.
- `chmod +x maid.sh`
- `./maid.sh`

## Important Notice
I likely dont know what I am doing and this could be done faster, better and simpler some other way. These scripts could also break your MacBook and make you cry.
